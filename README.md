Better Eating Everywhere

BEE is a single page calorie counting web application for weight loss. 

The back end was created using Java with the database being Postgresql.

The front end single page was achieved using Riot.js and Javascript. Manipulating JSON information from ajax calls makes up the
majority of the functionality, from the food lookup from a government database to the implementation of Chart.js to create a dynamic
graph.

A webhosted version of the applicationcan be accessed at: https://intense-chamber-67056.herokuapp.com/

Heroku can take some time to load images and other parts of the webpage on the first visit. This slowness does not exist under
mosty normal circumstances. You must register an account to view much of the website's functionality, but as there is no implementation
to use the email in any way besides login, you can feel free to use a non-existant email.
